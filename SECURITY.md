# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project follows semantic versioning. Security updates are provided for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid exposing users to unnecessary risk.

### 2. Report via GitHub Security Advisories

1. Go to the [Security Advisories page](../../security/advisories) for this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability
4. Include steps to reproduce if applicable
5. Suggest a fix if you have one

### 3. Alternative Contact Methods

If GitHub Security Advisories are not available, you can:
- Email: [Add your security contact email here]
- PGP Key: [Add PGP key if you use encrypted communication]

## Security Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days of report
- **Fix Development**: Varies based on complexity
- **Release**: Critical vulnerabilities within 30 days, others within 90 days

## Security Measures in Place

### Application Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **XSS Protection**: HTML escaping and Content Security Policy headers
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries using SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Security Headers**: 
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  - Content-Security-Policy with restricted sources

### Container Security

- **Base Image**: Alpine Linux for minimal attack surface
- **Non-Root User**: Application runs as non-privileged user (uid: 1000)
- **Read-Only Filesystem**: Container uses read-only root filesystem
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scans with Trivy and Docker Scout
- **Package Pinning**: All dependencies pinned to specific versions

### Kubernetes Security

- **Pod Security**: Non-root execution enforced
- **Network Policies**: Restricted network communication
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits set
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control configured
- **Secrets Management**: Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data
- **Health Checks**: Liveness and readiness probes configured

### CI/CD Security

- **Automated Scanning**: 
  - Trivy for container vulnerabilities
  - Bandit for Python security issues
  - Safety for dependency vulnerabilities
  - Hadolint for Dockerfile best practices
- **Security Testing**: Automated security test suite
- **Signed Images**: Container images are signed and verified
- **Branch Protection**: Main branch requires PR reviews and status checks

## Security Testing

This project includes comprehensive security testing:

```bash
# Run security validation
make security-scan

# Run security tests
make security-test

# Run Docker security scans
make scan-docker
```

### Security Test Coverage

1. **Input Validation Testing**
2. **XSS Protection Verification**
3. **SQL Injection Prevention**
4. **Security Headers Validation**
5. **HTTP Method Restrictions**
6. **Path Traversal Protection**
7. **Error Handling Security**

## Security Considerations for Production

### Additional Recommendations

- **TLS/HTTPS**: Use TLS termination at load balancer or ingress
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication (OAuth2, OIDC)
- **Authorization**: Add role-based access control for application features
- **Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive audit logging
- **Database Security**: Use production database with encryption at rest
- **Secrets Management**: Use dedicated secrets management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- **Network Segmentation**: Implement network segmentation and firewalls
- **Regular Security Assessments**: Conduct periodic penetration testing

### Environment-Specific Security

#### Development
- Use test data only
- Disable debug modes
- Local secrets only

#### Staging
- Mirror production security controls
- Use production-like data (anonymized)
- Enable security monitoring

#### Production
- Full security controls enabled
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Incident response procedures
- Regular backups and disaster recovery

## Compliance

This project follows security best practices from:

- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- [CIS Kubernetes Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes)
- [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)

## Security Tools and Integrations

- **Static Analysis**: Bandit, Safety
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy, Docker Scout
- **Kubernetes Security**: Pod Security Standards, Network Policies
- **CI/CD Security**: GitHub Security Features, SARIF uploads
