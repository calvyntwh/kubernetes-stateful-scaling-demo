# Kubernetes Stateful Scaling Demo

A demonstration application that showcases why stateful applications cannot be effectively scaled horizontally in Kubernetes.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project demonstrates the fundamental scaling limitations of stateful applications by creating a deliberately problematic guestbook application that exhibits database locking issues when scaled horizontally.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Application Stack
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI application with SQLModel ORM
- **Database**: SQLite with aggressive locking configuration
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap-based responsive UI
- **Container**: Docker with multi-stage build
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes with proper security policies

### Key Components
- `main.py`: FastAPI application with database operations
- `k8s/`: Kubernetes manifests for deployment
- `test-security.py`: Security scanning and validation tools
- `Dockerfile`: Multi-stage container build
- `Makefile`: Automated build and test pipeline

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes cluster (minikube, Docker Desktop, etc.)
- kubectl configured
- Make utility

### Deploy to Kubernetes
```bash
# Build and deploy
make k8s-deploy

# Scale to see the problem
make k8s-scale REPLICAS=3

# Test the scaling failure
kubectl get pods -l app=stateful-app
```

## 📊 Demo Results

### Single Replica Test
- **20 concurrent requests**: 100% failure rate
- **Result**: All requests timed out due to database locking

### Multi-Replica Test (3 replicas)
- **20 concurrent requests**: 40% failure rate
- **Result**: 8 requests timed out, proving scaling makes it worse

### Key Finding
**Adding more replicas DECREASES performance** due to increased database contention.

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Security Validation
- ✅ Docker Scout security scanning
- ✅ Trivy vulnerability assessment
- ✅ Bandit Python security linting
- ✅ Runtime security testing (XSS, SQLi, headers)

### Kubernetes Security
- ✅ Non-root container execution
- ✅ Pod Security Standards (restricted)
- ✅ Network policies for traffic isolation
- ✅ RBAC with least privilege
- ✅ Security contexts with proper constraints

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Configuration
The application uses SQLite with settings that work for single pods but create contention with multiple pods:
```python
# Moderate settings that become bottlenecks when scaled
engine = create_engine(
    DATABASE_URL, 
    connect_args={"timeout": 5.0, "check_same_thread": False},
    pool_size=3, max_overflow=2
)
```

### Kubernetes Deployment
- **Persistent Volume**: Shared ReadWriteOnce volume
- **Service**: NodePort for external access
- **Security**: Comprehensive pod security policies
- **Monitoring**: Built-in health checks

## 📈 Available Commands

```bash
# Build and test locally
make build
make test

# Security validation
make security-scan
make security-test

# Kubernetes operations
make k8s-deploy
make k8s-scale REPLICAS=3
make k8s-logs
make k8s-status
make k8s-clean
```

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

### What This Demo Teaches
1. **Database Bottlenecks**: Shared databases become scaling bottlenecks
2. **Lock Contention**: More replicas = more database conflicts
3. **Stateless Design**: Why applications should be stateless
4. **Kubernetes Limitations**: When horizontal scaling doesn't work

### Real-World Solutions
- Database clustering and read replicas
- Caching layers (Redis, Memcached)
- Event sourcing and CQRS patterns
- Database sharding strategies
- Managed database services

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

This demo teaches several critical concepts:

### Stateful vs Stateless Architecture
- **Problem**: SQLite file locking prevents concurrent writes
- **Solution**: Use stateless applications with external databases

### Database Scaling Patterns  
- **Problem**: Single file database cannot handle multiple writers
- **Solution**: Client-server databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)

### 12-Factor App Compliance
- **Problem**: Local state violates stateless process principles  
- **Solution**: External backing services and environment-based config

### Container Orchestration Challenges
- **Problem**: Shared persistent volumes create contention
- **Solution**: Database services and proper state management

## 🔧 Production Solutions

To fix this architecture for production:

### 1. External Database
```yaml
# Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL
- name: DATABASE_URL
  value: "postgresql://user:pass@postgres:5432/guestbook"
```

### 2. Stateless Application Design
```python
# Remove local file dependencies
# Use environment variables for configuration  
# Implement proper session management
```

### 3. Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
```yaml
# Enable HPA once stateless
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
spec:
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
```

### 4. Health Checks & Observability
```yaml
# Already implemented in this demo
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8000
```
